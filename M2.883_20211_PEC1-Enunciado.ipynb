    "\n",
    "El entorno __CliffWalking__ consiste en un agente que se mueve en una cuadrícula de dimensiones 12x4 (ancho x alto). En cada paso, el agente tiene 4 opciones de acción o movimiento: ARRIBA, DERECHA, ABAJO, IZQUIERDA. La posición de cada casilla viene dada por una pareja de números naturales [x, y], donde la posición de la esquina de arriba a la izquierda sería el origen de coordenadas [0, 0]. El agente siempre sale de la misma casilla [0, 3] (esquina abajo izquierda) y el juego termina cuando el agente llega a la casilla de llegada [11, 3] (esquina abajo derecha).\n",
    "\n",
    "El entorno se corresponde con el ejemplo 'Cuadrícula con precipicio' explicado en la sección 3.2.1. del módulo \"Métodos de Diferencia Temporal\". El problema radica en que en todas las casillas la recompensa inmediata es R=-1 excepto en las casillas que unen en línea recta la casilla de salida con la de llegada, casillas  [1, 3] a  [10, 3]. En estas casillas, que simulan un precipicio, la recompensa es R=-100 y se vuelve a la casilla inicial.\n",

    "<br><br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Tras realizar un estudio de las políticas obtenidas en cada uno de los diferentes algoritmos utilizados, Programación Dinámica (DP de ahora en adelante), Monte Carlo (MC de ahora en adelante) y SARSA, se puede afirmar que el único de los algoritmos que realmente consigue llegar a la política óptima es el algoritmo de DP, ya que consigue llegar al estado terminal en 12 pasos y con una puntuación final por tanto de -12 puntos, siendo esta la ruta óptima, mientras que los dos algoritmos restantes (MC y SARSA) consiguen llegar al estado terminal en 18 pasos y con una puntuación final de -18 puntos. Si que es cierto, que aunque los algoritmos de MC y SARSA no hayan conseguido llegar a una política óptima, si que han conseguido alcanzar una ruta que llega al estado terminal y que se considera subóptima para ellos, es decir, que es la mejor que han encontrado tras realizar las iteraciones correspondientes, y que dicha ruta es mejor que las anteriores que han obtenido a lo largo de la ejecución del algoritmo.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Las diferencias existente entre las políticas encontradas por los diferentes algoritmos empleados se debe al funcionamiento de los algoritmos y al tipo de problema del que se trata. El problema a resolver se trata de un problema del cual se conocen a priori las dinámicas del entorno y se trata de un problema simple que se adapta mejor al algoritmo de DP, que realiza una exploración de todas las puntuaciones obtenidas en cada estado para cada una de las acciones disponibles y se queda con aquellas que obtienen una mayor puntuación, teniendo en cuenta tanto los episodios actuales como los más alejados (debido al valor de la variable discount que corresponde con el factor de descuento). Por otro lado, están los algoritmos MC y SARSA basados en una política epsilon-greedy que aunque tiende a ser una política greedy como la utilizada en el algoritmo de DP, trata de probar todas las acciones posibles asegurando una aleatoriedad a la hora de seleccionar las mismas en las diferentes iteraciones, y de asignar un peso a cada par (estado, acción). La realización de los diferentes episodios siguiendo una política aleatoria, además de la forma de asignar la puntuación, hace que estos algoritmos tarden más en converger y en encontrar por tanto la política óptima cuando se trata de un problema simple como es este caso. \n",
    " \n",
    "    Realmente, la principal diferencia que hay entre las 3 rutas encontradas por los diferentes algoritmos es la distancia que hay con respecto al precipicio, en el primer algoritmo la ruta encontrada (la óptima), se encuentra pasando al borde del precipicio, mientras que los otros dos algoritmos se alejan del precipicio y luego llegan al estado terminal, esto es debido a que tanto MC como SARSA aplican una política epsilon-greedy, y al probar de forma aleatoria las diferentes acciones posibles, los estados que están más cercanos al precipicio tienen entre sus posibles acciones la caída al precipicio y un valor de retorno asociado con -500 de recompensa, por lo que las primeras rutas encontradas tratarán de alejarse de esos estados cercanos al precipicio.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    El número de episodios influye en cada uno de los algoritmos de forma diferente debido al diferente funcionamiento de los mismos.\n",
    "    Como podemos observar, el algoritmo de DP tarda en converger 15 iteraciones, siendo este el más rápido. Esto es debido, tal y como se ha indicado en las conclusiones anteriores, al funcionamiento del mismo y que este se adapta muy bien a este tipo de problemas en el que se conoce todo acerca del entorno y no es un problema excesivamente complejo.\n",
    "    Por otro lado, en el algoritmo de MC comienza a converger aproximadamente a partir de las 2500 iteraciones, debido a que se trata de un algoritmo que trabaja con una política aleatoria epsilon-greedy, que permite explorar las diferentes opciones diferentes en cada uno de los estados hasta que da con aquella que da mejores resultados, no va directamente por el camino óptimo como el algoritmo de DP, sino que aprende a travésde prueba y error y además actualiza al final de cada episodio, por lo que eso le hace que sea todavía más lento.\n",
    "    Por último, el método SARSA tarda más que el método de DP, pero mucho menos que el algoritmo de MC, debido a que a pesar de que este también utilice una política epsilon-greedy, actualiza los valores de los estados después de cada estado, no al terminar por completo el episodio, lo que hace que converja con un número de iteraciones mucho menor al algoritmo de MC, como se puede apreciar en las ejecuciones anteriores, este empieza a converger a partir de 80 iteraciones aproximadamente\n",

    "     Al ejecutar los algoritmos con un factor de descuento igual a 0.1, los algoritmos necesitan un número de iteraciones más elevado para encontrar la política óptima, esto es debido a que con un valor igual a 0.1 importan mucho más las recompensas a corto plazo que las obtenidas a largo plazo, lo que hace que el algoritmo tenga que realizar un mayor número de exploraciones para poder orientar los pasos más alejados del estado terminal hacia el mismo.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Si observamos los resultados obtenidos, en el caso del algoritmo de DP, vemos como este ha llegado a converger, según la condición de convergencia del mismo, pero sin llegar a encontrar una política que llegue al estado terminal, esto es debido a que al tener un valor de descuento más pequeño,  tal y como he indicado antes, se tiene menos en cuenta el valor de retorno de los estados a largo plazo, y por tanto se obtienen unos valores más pequeños para los estados, por lo que para que llegase a converger y encontrase la política óptima sería necesario establecer un valor de Theta más pequeño, ya que dicho valor se queda corto al utilizar un factor de descuento tan pequeño.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    En el caso del algoritmo de MC, con el mismo número de iteraciones (1670, debido a que 100.000 con un factor de descuento igual a 0.1 no he conseguido que me converga en días), vemos como con el antiguo valor asociado al factor de descuento, se obtiene una ruta mucho más orientada a la encontrada al realizar 100.000 iteraciones, y falla el hecho de llegar al final por el estado más cercano. Sin embargo, con el actual valor asociado al factor de descuento, 0.1, la política obtenida para el mismo número de operaciones está mucho más alejada de una política óptima, estando únicamente apuntando hacia el estado terminal aquellos estados más cercanos al mismo, debido a que se tiene mucho más en cuenta las recompensas asociadas a los estados cercanos. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Con el algoritmo de SARSA, con el nuevo valor asignado al valor de descuento no llega a encontrar una política que llegue al estado terminal con el número de iteraciones indicado, debido a que necesita un mayor número de iteraciones para llegar a encontrar una política que llegue al estado terminal, ya que el uso de un factor de descuento más pequeño, hace que sea necesario un mayor número de iteraciones para orientar hacia el estado terminal a aquellos estados más alejados del mismo.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    En resumen, realmente, los 3 algoritmos les ocurre lo mismo aunque en diferente medida, los estados que conducen hacia el estado terminal son los más cercanos al mismo debido al uso de un valor de descuento más pequeño que hace que se tengan en cuenta las recompensas en los estados más cercanos y menos en cuenta las recompensas en estados más alejados, por lo que no consigue orientar aquellas más alejadas del estado terminal.\n",

    "    El uso de un learning rate más pequeño (0.1) da un mejor resultado que el uso de un learning rate mayor (0.9), esto es debido a que un menor valor de learning rate le resta valor a la diferencia entre la recompensa inmediata recibida y el valor de retorno asociado al siguiente estado. Esta diferencia toma valores muy grandes en aquellos estados cercanos al precipicio, ya que al utilizar una política epsilon-greedy que es aleatoria, existe la posibilidad de elegir esas acciones y por tanto obtener un valor de retorno muy bajo, y que esta diferencia sea mayor y que el algoritmo trate de alejarse de dichos estados, los cuales dan lugar al camino óptimo. Al reducir el valor del parámetro learning rate, suaviza esta diferencia y tiene un camino más óptimo que el obtenido con un valor superior.\n",
